⚠️ Machine-based licenses are being retired (160-characters long). The existing Machine-based licenses will continue working for the lifetime of the PC, and "can be moved once within 1 year of purchase", per the original purchasing terms, but no new Machine-based licenses will be sold. It is possible to upgrade to User-based license that will work on any future PCs (and multiple PCs you might have today). Upgrade by clicking "Upgrade to User-Based license" from About dialog of the licensed PC. The upgrade currently costs $10 (price difference between User-based and Machine-based licenses) so nobody will be at a loss.
This doesn't affect licenses starting with "LIC-" or "U-" or "DOMAIN-".
